// MARK: - ink on a heightfield is hidden where the surface faces away
//
// A Gaussian ridge along y, seen from a plate camera whose sight line has a
// component across it: the near flank faces the eye, the steep part of the
// far flank faces away, and the far flank's foot faces the eye again. Ink run
// straight over the ridge on the surface must be cut at the two folds, found
// on the exact gradient; with nothing in front of it, the depth test alone
// keeps every vertex, which is the leak this test exists to close.
